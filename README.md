## 🔧 Options — choose what I should do next
1. **Generate final README with live badges and a screenshot section**  
   - I will add Shields (build, license, languages, latest commit), a `showcase/` image placeholder area for screenshots/GIFs, and polished formatting so it looks production-ready.  
   - Output: a single `README.md` ready to paste, plus the image filenames to add in `/assets/`.

2. **Auto-fill the full repo table (detailed)**  
   - I will visit each repo, extract the one-line description from its README, add a suggested icon per project, and auto-populate the table with repo links and recommended demo URLs (if present).  
   - Output: a longer README with the completed repo table and short summaries for every repo.

3. **Generate README assets (images/GIFs) for top 3 projects**  
   - I will create 3 small showcase images/GIF templates (900×450px or GitHub-friendly sizes) you can download and drop into `/assets/` to make your profile pop.  
   - Output: download links for 3 assets + the updated README snippet that references them.

_Pick 1, 2, or 3 and I’ll produce the chosen output right away._

## 🛠️ How to add icons, badges, screenshots, and deploy links (step-by-step)

### Add icons (emoji or small SVG)
- Quick: use emoji in the repo table (e.g., `🔒`, `🛰️`, `🧪`) — easiest and supported everywhere.
- For custom icons:
  1. Create `/assets/icons/` in your profile repo and add small PNG/SVG (32×32 or 64×64).  
  2. Reference like: `![IoT](/assets/icons/iot.svg)` in the table cell next to the repo name.

### Add badges (Shields.io)
- Common badges (paste at top of README):
